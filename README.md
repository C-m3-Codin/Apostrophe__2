A Flutter Project Based on Seller Logistics

An application that lets sellers manage and track orders made by buyers in real-time. 
The application would show details of all orders according to their current status regarding :
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Delivery</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Location</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Delivery agent contacts
</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Customer Feedback
</p>
	</li>
</ul>
Delivery agent will be equipped with tracker, updating real-time location details accurately.
